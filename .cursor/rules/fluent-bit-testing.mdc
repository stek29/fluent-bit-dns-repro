# Fluent Bit Testing Procedures

When testing Fluent Bit behavior, always recreate the fluent-bit container to avoid reading older logs:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate fluent-bit
```

This ensures:
- Clean container state
- No cached DNS resolutions
- Fresh log output without previous test artifacts
- Accurate reproduction of issues

**Important**: If DNS configuration changes, also restart the DNS container:
```bash
docker compose restart dns
docker compose up -d --force-recreate fluent-bit
```

This rule applies to testing scenarios in the [docker-compose.yml](mdc:docker-compose.yml) setup where DNS resolution issues are being investigated.
